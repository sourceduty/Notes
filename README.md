### Alex's GitHub Notes

- I indicate versions of my code very loosely.
- I create repositories for source codes and related information.
- I'm probably the first person to create a repository index.
- To me, a project is a larger task with more than one script.
- I use a lot of different words that mean the same thing.
- I use the same design process in programming as I do in 3D modelling.
- I prefer to use a repository for these notes instead of gists.
