### Alex's GitHub Notes

1. I indicate versions of my code very loosely.
2. I create repositories for source codes and related information.
3. I'm probably the first person to create a repository index.
4. To me, a project is a larger task with more than one script.
5. I use a lot of different words that mean the same thing.
6. I use the same design process in programming as I do in 3D modelling.
